title: Thoughts On Hipster Food
---

I'm currently visiting the city of Austin, and while there wanted to try some of the cuisine. Austin is one of those curious little cities that are growing way too fast–I think it's the fastest growing city in the US–and with it comes growing pains such as the gentrification of neighborhoods. And of course, with gentrification comes hipster food.

The problem I see with hipster food, is that it seems like a cash grab. Hipster food sells because it appeals to the natural sense of curiosity people have, rather than their taste buds. Now I'm not saying that all of these new restaurants with the stainless steel finishes and hip hop blaring in the background are ass, it's just that I find that the food sort of lackluster?

In Austin, there's was this massively hyped ramen shop. Well, maybe not massively. It was more *Antman 2* than *Infinity War*. When I first came across this little shop, it had an insanely long line; about one hour. "Oh wow," I thought. "The food must be pretty good." Not wanting to wait a long time just to eat dinner, however, I went to eat someplace else. However, the next day I visited the restaurant at an odd hour, and the wait was only about five minutes.

I ordered the *Classic* or the *Original*, I forget which, but needless to say the food was a bit disappointing. Back home, the ramen quality was a lot better for a lot cheaper. But this food got me thinking. Why exactly was the ramen so popular?

Austin doesn't really have a large Asian population (outside of the university), so my guess is that most people simply don't exactly know what good ramen tastes like. Keep in mind, I'm not saying that the ramen I had was *bad*, but rather I'm saying that it was not really worth a long wait to have. But I felt like writing this blog post because I was really, *really* surprised at the discrepancy between the length of the line and the quality of the food.

After finishing this post, I realized that maybe through criticizing the hipster, I have become the hipster? Ranting about useless things that most people don't really care about is indicative of our hipster friends, but whatever. I just wanted to get this out there.
