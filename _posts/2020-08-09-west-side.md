I recently finished watching the *West Side Story* movie. It was long! About 2 and a half hours!

I don't know if this was intentional or not, but I kinda hated every character. They were all naive to the point of stupidity, and I didn't really feel anything when they received the consequences for their actions. Perhaps I'm a psychopath.

I think the film was implicitly about the intersection of homosexuality and toxic masculinity. But since it was the 60s, they couldn't explicitly explore those themes. Maybe I am overanalyzing it. The 60s *were* a crazy time.

Overall, I would rate it **similar** to *La La Land*.
