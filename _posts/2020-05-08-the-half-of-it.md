title: The Half Of It Thoughts

Recently, I watched *The Half Of It* on Netflix. I liked it.

Premise was interesting. You don't really see LGBTQ Asians in media too much.

I liked the setting of a train station. People coming and going, yet you're still stuck in a small town. Very nice.

Chu should have charged more than $20 a paper. Unless she's a god-like writer, that's like $7 an hour.

I don't know how to feel about sausage taco.

In my opinion, the Yakult stuff should have been cut. It honestly felt like an ad at times, where interesting scenes had characters drinking Yakult or stuffing it in their pockets or something. It was honestly farcical at times. [This article](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504233115/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akw5qa/how-yakult-yogurt-drink-became-a-netflix-star-alice-wu-the-half-of-it) says Wu added the tangy drink because it was "relevant yet still identifiable." Maybe. But if I was working at the SEC I would take a look at Wu's endeavors in `YKLTY`.

The movie's theme seemed to be about challenging complacency. Munsky trying out new sausage recipes. Flores questioning her marriage to Trig. Of course, Chu's sexuality. Was the movie successful in conveying this message? Certainly at the end of the movie everyone found their way to success, but I'm not sure if the movie did a good job on this matter. Wu seemed way too focused on establishing the complacency than showing the characters challenging it in my opinion. Various sermon scenes. Mr. Wu never learning English and constantly watching old movies on an ancient television. Flores chilling with Trig. Chu wing-manning for Munsky, enabling complacency. People moaning about this small-ass town. Only until the last twenty minutes of the film did wheels start turning. However, I think the demonstration of the characters processing their emotions was kinda quick too. For Munsky, it was a WikiHow scene and then suddenly the church scene (at least, that's what I remember). I don't think we even saw Flores at all until then. Chu was really the only exception, and she should be as the main character. I just think the others could have been fleshed out a bit more.

I liked how the characters risked approval from parental figures, which honestly, I think is the right choice for a high-school movie. It keeps the movie relatable for most teens.

I honestly don't know what to think about the kiss scene. I'm trying to think about it in terms of the entire picture.

After some thought, I think that I shouldn't overanalyze it and just take it as it isâ€“a kiss scene at the end of the high-school romcom. There were some quotes about love being messy that probably hinted at this. Whatever.

Ending was sort of interesting. The transformation of Chu's view of Squahamish from a hated place to a source of anticipation got a few neurons firing. I guess it shows Chu's frustration was not with the town itself, but rather herself? Maybe the reason everybody hated Squahamish was because it never changed due to the townsfolks' apathy. I'm not smart enough to be sure.

To college! Just like in *Love, Simon*!

Overall, I would rate *The Half Of It* higher than `Crazy Rich Asians`. Go see it if the premise sounds interesting.
