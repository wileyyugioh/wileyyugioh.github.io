I watched Puss in Boots on Netflix the other day.

First off, let me say that the visuals were very nice. The cloud scene when they plant the magic beans was top notch.

However, I thought the plot was a little bit sterile. There wasn't really any conflict or character changeâ€“none of the protagonists really learn anything substantial. And when the "real" bad guy finally appears an hour into the film, the typical change of heart for children's films occured in a record-breaking 10 minutes. *Puss in Boots* unfortunately is a movie that stands in the shadow of *Shrek*.

Overall, I would rate it **worse** than *La La Land*.
