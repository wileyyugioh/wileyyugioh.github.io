Reading through these abandoned blogs gives me this unique feeling of nostalgia tinged with sadness. It's the same feeling I get when I see that a beloved family-run restaurant closed down because of slow business, or when I said goodbye to friends, knowing that I would never meet them again. The Japanese have a term for this sadness of the passing of life, "[mono no aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware)."

The internet has allowed for anyone to share content to thousands, if not millions, of people which would have been unthinkable before. It seems that everyday a cat or a baby goes viral and amasses millions of likes from a cheering crowd of supporters. However, the incredible expansion of the internet also created empty spaces where one could be entirely alone, and this is exactly where dead blogs ironically live.

I guess the appeal to me of these unknown blogs is the pure passion they possess that seems non-existent in today's superficial and vapid internet. It's the digital embodiment of a dude standing on his soapbox, shouting his thoughts, hopes, and dreams to an empty forum, until one day, he has nothing more to say.
