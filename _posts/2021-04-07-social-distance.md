title: How Much Space for Social Distancing?

I was laying on my couch the other day, and thinking, "how much square feet would be required for the whole world to social distance?"

The most compact arrangement of people is this:

<p style="text-align:center">

</p>

For a single square, this arrangement has $ 1 * 1 + 4 * \frac{1}{4} = 2 $ people.

The area of this square for a social distance of six feet is $ {\frac{2*6}/{\sqrt{2}}}^2 = 2 * 36 = 72 $ ft squared.

So this would be a population density of:

$$ \frac{2 people}{72 ft^2} * \frac{5280^2 ft^2}{1^2 mi^2} = 774,400 \frac{person}{mi^2} $$

For reference, the most densely populated city, Manilla, has a density of [$ 107,520 \frac{person}{mi^2} $](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density).

So for 8 billion people:

$$ \frac{8B}{} * \frac{1 mi^2}{774,400 people} \approx 10,300 mi^2 $$

This was a waste of time, and nothing new was learned.
