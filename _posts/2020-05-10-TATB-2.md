Pretty much exactly what I expected. Lots of pop songs, lots of drama, lots of adults masquerading as teenagers.

Was it better or worst than the original TATB? That's a hard question. The first TATB was a trainwreck when it came to the story, where I didn't know what was going on. In this film, at least the plot was more coherent. It was still a trainwreck, but like Amtrack hitting a penny and jumping off the rails versus a tank car exploding on a bridge. However, I think that the first movie is a much more fun watch than the second because of that.

The ending was horrible.

Overall, I would rank it **worse** than *Crazy Rich Asians*.
