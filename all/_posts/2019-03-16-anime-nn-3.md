title: Lazily Building A Smug Anime Face Neural Network For Kicks Pt. 3

Recently, I got a beefier graphics card, the Vega 64, but the thing is that Tensorflow does not natively support OpenCL. Fortunately, I found a library called plaidml, which is fabulous. plaidml allows me to use Keras on my AMD card on Windows!

I ran the DCGAN overnight and the image above is what resulted. In the earlier posts, I outputted 256x256 images, but in order to speed up the process I lowered the resolution to 64x64.

As you can see, I probably overtrained the neural network. In the future, I want to generate more data. Right now I have about ~7.5k, but I can double it by changing the brightness of the images or whatever.

**TO BE CONTINUED?**
